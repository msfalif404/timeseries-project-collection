# Time Series Project Collection

- This repository aims to store random time series projects that I've learned about and created from various sources, such as websites and YouTube.
- This repository could be considered a "toy time series project collection" because I don't cover anything serious like in-depth data exploration, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
